## Summary

I build design systems that work in the real world—with metrics to prove it.

I built my last company's first design system from scratch, solo, in an engineer-first culture. The results: **90% QA reduction, 70% clean handoff rate, ~1,920 hours saved through component reuse**, now deployed across 7 products. I didn't just design it—I built the automation too. I'm quick to adopt new technologies when they solve real problems: leveraged AI tools to build custom GitHub Actions that push design tokens from Figma straight into production CSS.

The last 2 years have been deep in UI and product work. I've stepped into product strategy on small teams with zero PM structure, co-owned full product lifecycles from pitch to MVP, and learned to think like a product person while staying a designer.

I think in systems and token architecture. I thrive in ambiguous environments where you have to build the plane while flying it. **Currently developing a Figma plugin** (under review by Figma for community release) that democratises design token workflows while seeking **Senior UI Designer or Design Systems Lead roles** where craft meets strategic impact.

## Current Projects

### Figma-to-GitHub Plugin
*December 2025 - Present · Under review by Figma for community plugins*

Building a Figma-native plugin that eliminates the TokenStudio workflow complexity and bypasses Figma API subscription barriers.

**What it solves:**
- Direct push from Figma Variables to GitHub (JSON format)—no expensive API tier required
- Eliminates multi-step translation: Figma → TokenStudio → Git transformation
- User-controlled PR creation on push
- One-click GitHub Action deployment for automated CSS transformation

**Status:** Submitted to Figma for community plugin review, December 2025.
