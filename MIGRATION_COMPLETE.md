# Migration to Vanilla JS Complete

## What Changed

Your portfolio has been successfully migrated from React + TypeScript to vanilla HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

```
Fullscreens/
├── index.html           # Main HTML file with all sections
├── package.json         # Updated dependencies (removed React & TypeScript)
├── vite.config.js       # Vanilla JS Vite configuration
├── src/
│   ├── main.js         # All JavaScript interactions and GSAP animations
│   ├── index.css       # Base CSS
│   ├── styles/
│   │   └── main.scss   # Main SCSS stylesheet with all styles
│   ├── assets/         # Images and assets
│   └── guidelines/     # Design guidelines
```

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic markup for all sections
- **SCSS** - Styles with variables, nesting, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - ES6+ with modules
- **GSAP** - Advanced animations and ScrollTrigger
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server

## What Was Removed

- ❌ React
- ❌ TypeScript
- ❌ All `.tsx` and `.jsx` component files
- ❌ TypeScript configuration files
- ❌ React-specific dependencies

## What Was Kept

- ✅ All HTML structure (already in index.html)
- ✅ All SCSS styles (in src/styles/main.scss)
- ✅ All JavaScript animations (in src/main.js)
- ✅ GSAP library for animations
- ✅ Vite for development and building

## Features Implemented in JavaScript

### Animations (GSAP)
- Scroll-triggered section animations
- Project image parallax effects
- Fade-in animations for content
- Staggered metric card animations
- Smooth CTA button interactions
- Dynamic job title rotation

### Navigation
- Smooth scroll to sections
- Active nav state based on scroll position
- Click handlers for all navigation links

### Interactions
- Hover effects on CTA buttons
- Lazy loading for images
- Intersection Observer for performance

## How to Use

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Opens the site at http://localhost:3000

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
Creates optimized files in the `dist` folder

### Preview Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers supported with responsive design

## Performance Optimizations

- SCSS compiled to optimized CSS
- JavaScript bundled and minified in production
- Lazy loading for images
- Intersection Observer for efficient scroll detection
- GSAP ScrollTrigger for performant scroll animations

## Notes

- The HTML in `index.html` contains all your content statically
- SCSS is automatically compiled by Vite
- JavaScript handles all interactivity and animations
- No build step needed for development (Vite handles it)
- Production builds are optimized automatically

Your portfolio is now lighter, faster, and uses standard web technologies!
