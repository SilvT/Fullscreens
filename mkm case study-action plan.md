# Marketing Management Case Study: Action Plan

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Do you need to modify your projects.json structure?**
YES - Minor tweaks to top-level fields

**Do you need to create more blocks?**
YES - 4 new block types that are essential for this case study's complexity

**Why?**
Your case study is brilliant but too narrative-heavy for portfolio scanning. These new blocks transform "dense read" into "must-hire immediately."

## 🚀 Your Implementation Steps

### **PHASE 1: Essential Setup** ✅ COMPLETED

#### Step 1: Add New Block Types to JavaScript ✅
**File:** `src/js/modules/caseStudy.js`

All 4 new block renderer functions have been implemented:
- `renderStoryHook()` - Opening engagement moment
- `renderTimelineProcess()` - Phase storytelling
- `renderBeforeAfterComparison()` - Impact visualization
- `renderKeyInsight()` - Callout/highlight moment

All cases added to `renderBlock()` switch statement.

---

#### Step 2: Add Styles ✅
**File:** `src/scss/case-study.scss`

All styles implemented for new content blocks with responsive design and theme support.

---

#### Step 3: Data Structure Refactoring ✅
**Files:** `src/data/projects.json` + `src/data/mkm-content.json`

**Implemented lazy-loading architecture:**
- **projects.json** - Lightweight card-display data only
  - Title, company, year, tags
  - Card overview & story teaser
  - Hero image, theme, card metrics
  - `contentFile` pointer to detailed content

- **mkm-content.json** - Full case study content (lazy-loaded)
  - Subtitle, job title, duration
  - Detail metrics (6 items)
  - All content blocks (story-hook, timeline, before-after, etc.)

**Benefits:**
- Faster initial page load
- Better maintainability (each case study in own file)
- Content only loads when user opens case study

---

#### Step 4: Navigation Updates ✅

**Case Study Breadcrumbs:**
- Changed from "all projects list" to "Previous/Next" navigation
- Matches project card navigation pattern
- Hover reveals project titles
- Space-between layout with proper spacing to avoid close button overlap
- Removed deprecated `cs-nav-hints` elements

**Project Cards:**
- Fixed `heroImage` vs `images[0]` compatibility for refactored structure

---

### **IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

**Completed:**
- ✅ All 4 new content block types (story-hook, timeline-process, before-after-comparison, key-insight)
- ✅ Complete SCSS styling with theme support
- ✅ Data structure refactored for lazy loading (projects.json + mkm-content.json)
- ✅ Case study breadcrumbs redesigned (Previous/Next pattern)
- ✅ Navigation hints removed
- ✅ Lazy loading implementation in caseStudy.js
- ✅ Image compatibility fix for project cards

**Content Status:**
- ✅ Full MKM case study content structured in JSON format
- ✅ All 7 sections implemented with proper block types
- ✅ 6 detail metrics configured
- ✅ Story teaser added to project card

**Time Invested:** ~3 hours

---

#### Step 4: Create Visual Assets

**Images you need:**
1. `mkm-hero.png` - Main dashboard or system overview
2. `chaos-state.png` - Diagram showing data fragmentation
3. `unified-platform.png` - Consolidated view after
4. `team-structure-diagram.png` - Team org chart
5. `collaboration-model.png` - Decision framework
6. `facebook-integration-flow.png` - API integration
7. `complaint-routing-diagram.png` - FB-to-CRM pipeline
8. `design-system-tokens.png` - Token architecture
9. `component-library.png` - Components showcase

**Time:** 4-6 hours (depending on if you already have these or need to create from scratch)

---

### **PHASE 2: Content Adaptation (The meaty work)**

#### Step 5: Map Your Markdown to JSON Structure

Use the **7 sections** from the restructuring guide:

1. **Section 1: The Hook** (story-hook)
   - Quote: "How did I get here?"
   - Context: "Seven months in..."

2. **Section 2: The Challenge** (before-after-comparison + two-column-with-sidebar)
   - Before: Chaos list
   - After: Solution list
   - Constraints detail

3. **Section 3: Role & Partnership** (two-column-with-sidebar)
   - Co-ownership model
   - Validation network
   - Decision framework

4. **Section 4: The Journey** (timeline-process + key-insights)
   - 3 phases with highlights
   - Key insight: Design system decision
   - Key insight: Facebook API win
   - Key insight: Feature invention

5. **Section 5: Key Wins** (text-image-split + two-column-with-sidebar)
   - Facebook API approval
   - FB-to-CRM pipeline
   - Design system adoption

6. **Section 6: Results** (metrics-inline + two-column-with-sidebar)
   - 8 metrics
   - Impact details
   - CEO feedback

7. **Section 7: Learnings** (two-column-with-sidebar)
   - 6 key learnings
   - What I'd do differently

**Time:** 3-4 hours

---

#### Step 6: Test on Multiple Devices

**Test at these breakpoints:**
- 320px (smallest phones)
- 375px (iPhone SE)
- 768px (tablet)
- 1024px (laptop)
- 1440px+ (desktop)

**Check for:**
- Text readability
- Image sizing
- Block stacking behavior
- Button/link hit areas

**Time:** 1 hour

---

### **PHASE 3: Polish (Optional but recommended)**

#### Step 7: Add Interactive Elements

**Possible enhancements:**
1. Timeline phases expandable on click
2. Animated transitions on before-after comparison
3. Hover effects on key-insights
4. Smooth scroll to sections

**Time:** 2-4 hours (if you want these)

---

#### Step 8: Get Feedback

**Test with 2-3 people:**
- Give them 30 seconds
- Ask: "What do you remember?"
- Look for: Did they catch the hook? Do they understand the impact?

**Time:** 1 hour (including adjustments)
